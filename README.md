###### TODO

HTML:

CSS:

Sass - 1st project

Underline pseudo el trick - not part of design (but sometime nice to experiment with diff ideas to test whether they were appropiate for virtual audience/company)

JS:

NPM + packages - Parcel bundler | Font Awesome icons

Intersection observer API (sticky header box-shadow + opacity 0.9)
